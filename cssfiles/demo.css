	Ater (#206739) helped me figure out some of the code and I took a note from him when it came to organizing.
	He wrote the Firefox-friendly logo replacement, and also helped with the CSS credit.
	If you feel as though I need to credit someone else, just message me.
	A lot of this was done by looking at various guides and LD's code, as well as w3schools and stackexchange.
